PRESENTATION OF ALGORITHM
SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 	The primary objective of this project is to address the transportation issue within our campus.
 	Our goal is to determine the most efficient route between two distinct locations on campus by finding the shortest path connecting them.
 	We plan to incorporate the Vogel approximation method into our project solution to optimize the transportation process and improve efficiency. 
OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED BY THE GROUP
	We successfully determined the shortest paths within weighted graphs, effectively solving this problem.
	In order to implement the graphs, we developed classes using the Java programming language.
	Two different representations, namely the adjacency matrix and adjacency list, were employed to create graphs in Java.
	Here are some aspects of code design that were critiqued in relation to the key algorithms used in the project:
 	Vogel’s algorithm
 	A* Search
 	Breadth-First Search


KEY FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM DEVELOPED
	The primary feature of the system was to assist users in obtaining the most optimal route between two specified locations, ensuring it is the shortest possible distance.

ALGORITHMS USED AND HOW THEY WERE INTEGRATED IN THE PROJECT
	 Firstly, ensure that the node or location being searched for is not empty.
	Assign appropriate distance values to the different locations that can be utilized in the search.
	Input the desired locations, specifying the source or starting point and the destination.
	Once the locations are provided, retrieve the nearby nodes or vertices associated with the given location.
	Compare the nodes of the various vertices to identify the shortest path.
	If a particular node or location offers the shortest distance to the destination without any obstacles, select that path. Save the obtained paths as references for future use.
	It is possible to add or remove locations and their respective distances as needed.
	If the current nodes do not yield the shortest path, continue comparing and evaluating until the desired path is discovered.
	Once the shortest path to the destination is found, conclude the program.

Usage:
 	1.  To use the user interface, follow these steps:
 	2.  Select the current location from the dropdown list.
 	3.  Select the destination from the dropdown list.
 	4.  Click the "Discover routes" button to find the shortest route.
 	5.  The shortest route will be displayed in the designated area.
 	6.  The estimated distance of the route will be shown below.
 	7.  Optionally, click the "Landmark button" to switch to the LandMarkPage.

LESSONS LEARNT
	The shortest route is not only implemented using the Dijkstra algorithms.
	Vogel’s algorithm is one of the best algorithms for transportation problems.
	Teamwork is very important in accomplishing tasks such as these.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
PLANS:
 	The project development team took into account the precise tasks to be performed to meet the project's objectives along with how the project is to be handled
 	In order to reach the deadline, milestones were created.
 	The team then searched for the best approach—such as the Vogel Approximation Method to help accomplish the set goals.

EXECUTION:
 	In order to complete the project, the methods and algorithms were put into practice.
 	It was made sure that the work was finished in accordance with the project's scope and plans.

DOCUMENTATION:
 	The secretary took notice of when each task was completed in the team’s notebook
MANAGEMENT OF RISKS
	By following the milestones set, any unforeseen problems that arose were handled accordingly.
	The close eye that the testing team kept on the project helped the team to avoid a whole lot of errors.



FEEDBACK AND APPROVAL
	The feedback gotten from the testing team helped to complete the project on time. They were very thorough in their testing and raised any objections they had immediately. Due to this, their approval was highly regarded.

DEPLOYMENT
	The compilation team put the work together in the most efficient way possible.
	The team combined individual codes and made them come out as one piece.
	The team was then able to run a working code.
